# David Adam Silva - Portfolio

## Hey there! üëã

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my journey from musician to web developer. It's built with clean, semantic code and designed to work beautifully on all devices.

## What's Inside

**About Me** - How 21 years as a session guitarist shaped my approach to coding  
**Projects** - Three real projects I've built, complete with live demos  
**Contact** - Easy ways to get in touch with me

## Tech Stuff I Used

- **HTML5** with proper semantic structure
- **CSS3** with Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties
- **Responsive design** that works on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Google Fonts** and **Font Awesome** icons
- **Mobile-first** approach

**‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status:** *The contact form is currently frontend-only and doesn't send messages yet. I'm working on adding backend functionality soon!*

## What Makes It Special

It reflects my unique background in music and how those skills translate to web development. The design is clean and professional, but with personality. Everything's fully responsive, accessible, and built with the same attention to detail I bring to everything I do. 

## Want to Connect?

I'm always open to chatting about projects, collaborations, or just geeking out about code (or guitars!). Feel free to reach out through any of the contact links on the site.
